 <h3>Massive team battles</h3>
 <p>It's great to dream of being the ace who saves the day, but it's only through teamwork that you and your
 allies prevail. 30 tanks split between two teams battle for supremacy on over a dozen
 intricately-designed maps. Do your best to collaborate,
 and your allies will work with you to unleash an unstoppable assault against your enemies!</p>

 <h3>Multiple game modes</h3>
 <p>World of Tanks: Xbox 360 Edition offers three distinct game modes: Standard,
 Encounter, and Assault. Standard battles are intense "capture" scenarios where two teams attempt
 to secure the opposing base. Encounter battles offer only one base to capture,
 and teams fight tooth-and-nail to keep it. In Assault mode, players get a pitched battle between
 attackers and defenders during a single-base engagement.</p>
